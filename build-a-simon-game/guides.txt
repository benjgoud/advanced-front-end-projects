Features
Game:
- Need array for key sequences
- Need to be able to reset game key (array) to 0
- Need to keep track of the users 'level' of play
- Need to regulate speed of game
- Non-Strict Mode: Every time the user makes a mistake, a notification is displayed and the previous key sequence starts again.
- Strict Mode: user clicks the wrong button, the game restarts from the beginning.
- {Optional} Need to increase speed after the 5th, 9th, 13th levels
- The game ends if the user completes 20 levels successfully

AI
- Random Number Generator for 'AI' to select keys
- No same select as last key function ex. AI doesn't select blue again for the next choice. We don't have to do that, but it seems like a good add.


User
- User clicks start button to begin game
-  User clicks reset button to end current game and remove score {optional separate button}
- User starts with random start key
- User receives a random key selection from the computer that is then added to the total from the previous round.
